<h2><a name = "Title2"> 2. Project Description </a></h2>

The [GuideXP](https://guidexp.wordpress.com) is a local startup in Canberra with the vision of creating immersive visitor experiences for galleries, museums and more. GuideXP is a unique, cloud-based approach to audio guides, which allows for access to content from multiple attractions in one place and aims to minimise effort required in uploading and updating content.
In 2019, GuideXP partnered with the ANU TechLauncher program to kick start our development. The program will create a first stage of the product roadmap while engaging with students and providing them real world experience.

Until now, GuideXP has created a guide for the National Capital Exhibition (NCE),  and multi-language function has been realized with a well-designed database. Currently, four languages are supported: English, Mandarin, Korean and Japanese. This semester(2020 S1) the project will focus more on stakeholders who are content creators or uploaders to enable them to create and edit exhibitions in a convenient way.

The GuideXP Team consists of four members plus the ANU TechLauncher team, with a myriad of experience in tech delivery projects, startups, and visitor experience. GuideXP are still seeking more partner institutions to create or share visitor experience content and provide feedback as development of the minimum viable product and test of value propositions. The partner institution will benefit from free use of the service for the duration of 2020.
